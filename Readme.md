# Finance Tracker

I am building a simple personal finance tracker to record income and expenses, categorize transactions, and view simple reports.

## Project Setup & Vision

### What I'm building
- A web app where I can:
  - Add income and expense entries
  - See totals and balance
  - View a simple history of transactions

### Tools I'll use
- Python — my main language
- Flask — lightweight web framework to serve pages
- HTML/CSS — basic web interface
- SQLite — simple database to store transactions

## Features
- I can add, edit, and delete transactions.
- I can categorize transactions and view summary reports by date and category.
- I can export my data as CSV.
